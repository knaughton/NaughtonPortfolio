		<!-- About me -->
			<div class="container3">Hello! My name is Kevin Naughton. Since graduating from Eastern Michigan University, in the spring of 2007, I've been working as a middle and high school math teacher.
					Upon graduation, I moved out to Phoenix, Arizona for 8 years. While I enjoyed my time living out West, I wanted to come home to Michigan to be closer to family and friends.
					At the end of the 2015 school year I packed up my things and began the long trek from the Sonoran Desert to the Great Lakes.
				<br>
				<br>I'm excited to participate in Grand Circus's Front-End Bootcamp and look forward to learning the necessary skills needed to be a successful developer. </p>

			I often use these quotes in my classroom, I enjoy sharing them with students. I believe that quotes are great conversation starters, it allows people an opportunity to share how they perceive something or what it may mean to them personally.</em>
