	Hello! My name is Kevin Naughton. Since graduating from Eastern Michigan University, in the spring of 2007, I've been working as a middle and high school math teacher. Upon graduation, I moved out to Phoenix, Arizona for 8 years. While I enjoyed my time living out West, I wanted to come home to Michigan to be closer to family and friends. At the end of the 2015 school year I packed up my things and began the long trek from the Sonoran Desert to the Great Lakes. 
<br>
<br>I'm excited to participate in Grand Circus's Front-End Bootcamp and look forward to learning the necessary skills needed to be a successful developer. </p>

		<div class="div1"><h2>Quotes<img class="quote" src="images/ThoughtBubble.jpg" alt="Quote" width="100" height="100" alight="right" /></h2>Below are five of my favorite quotes. They are quotes that I have read, heard or encountered throughout my life. I often use these quotes in my classroom, I enjoy sharing them with students. I believe that quotes are great conversation starters, it allows people an opportunity to share how they perceive something or what it may mean to them personally.
